# Ansible Role: F5 automation tool chain (ATC) deploy declaration

This role deploys declaratives to installed automation tool chain services (AS3, DO, TS) on your BIG-IP or BIG-IQ. You would use this role to post declarations to the following BIG-IP or BIG-IQ automation tool chain services: application services 3 extension, declaritive onboarding, or telemetry streaming. Information regarding these services along with example declaritives is available on [f5-cloud-docs](https://clouddocs.f5.com/).

* note: this role determines which service to use by the referenced declarative which should contain the service class.
For example, AS3 declaratives will contain a service pointer using key "class": with value "AS3" in json declared file [Example](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/declarations/http-services.html#http-with-custom-persistence). Be sure to define service pointers at the beginning of your declaration.

## Requirements

Corresponding ATC service must be installed on BIG-IP or BIG-IQ prior to deploying declaration.

## Role Variables

If you set “showHash=true”, the results include an optimisticLockKey for each tenant. Attempts to change/update any of the tenants without the correct optimisticLockKey will fail. |
