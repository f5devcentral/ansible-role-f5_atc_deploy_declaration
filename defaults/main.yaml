# POSTing to a specific AS3 tenant.
#
# Optional
#
# Starting with AS3 3.14.0, you have the option of using POST to the /declare endpoint
# with a specific tenant in the URI (for example …/declare/tenant1). This only updates
# the tenant you specified, even if there are other tenants in the declaration. This
# can be useful in some automation scenarios involving AS3.

# For example, when POSTING to the URI /mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare/tenant1,tenant2:
#
# If both tenant1 and tenant2 are in the declaration you are posting, both tenants are
# updated and AS3 returns both tenants in the response.
#
# If only tenant1 is present in the declaration you are posting, only tenant1 is updated
# and returned in the response, despite the fact tenant2 is included in the URI.
#
# If the tenant in the URI and the tenant in the declaration do not match (for example, only
# tenant3 is present in the declaration), AS3 returns a “no change” response.
#
# Default is null.
as3_tenant:

# You can use the following URL query parameters for POST, GET, or DELETE
#
# Required
#
# base means system returns the declaration as originally deployed (but with secrets
# like passphrases encrypted), full returns the declaration with all default schema
# properties populated, expanded includes all URLs, base64s, and other references expanded
# to their final static values.
#
# Acceptable values include: base, full, expanded
#
# Default is base

# You can use the following URL query parameters for POST (Note: showHash for POST was
# introduced in AS3 3.14.0 and will only work on 3.14.0 and later):
#
# This was introduced as a protection mechanism for tenants in a declaration
# (previously you had to use a separate GET request to retrieve the Optimistic lock).
# If you set “showHash=true”, the results include an optimisticLockKey for each tenant.
# Attempts to change/update any of the tenants without the correct optimisticLockKey will fail.
#
# Optional
#
# Default is false.
